# Monster Hunter Icons (SVG)

This project offers fan-made, non-commercial vector recreations of Monster Hunter icons — carefully redrawn and shared with the community.  
These assets are intended for content creators, website and application developers, and fans who simply enjoy the series and want to build cool things around it.  
Feel free to use them in your personal or creative projects, as long as they are not used for any commercial purpose (including resale on third-party platforms).
